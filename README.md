# michaelparkins.com

This is my personal site, [michaelparkins.com](http://michaelparkins.com), built with [Angular](https://angular.io/) and hosted on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

## Stack

- [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Spectator](https://ngneat.github.io/spectator/)
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)

## Purpose

I've made my site open source so that others can see how I put it together, maybe even get inspired. I don't expect any contributions, which is why the repo lacks a CONTRIBUTING.md. I also don't expect anyone will want to fork the repo, but if you do, please consider tossing in an attribution by linking back to [michaelparkins.com](http://michaelparkins.com).

## Local setup

```console
git clone https://github.com/michael-parkins/personal-site-ngx.git
cd personal-site-ngx
npm install
ng serve
```
