        I'm an open source developer advocate. Currently, I co-lead the Open Source Program Office at
        <a class="cursor-pointer text-pink-400" href="https://www.progressive.com/">Progressive</a>. Any day I can help

        As a developer, my passion is around making great web apps and easy to consume API. Developing web apps is a
        chance to enjoy the blending of science and art. Being creative while considering usability, accessibility,
        inclusivity, and simplicity is perfection, like a delicious bowl of hot ramen üçú.
