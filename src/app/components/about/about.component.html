    I'm an open source developer advocate. Currently, I co-lead the Open Source Program Office at
    <app-link href="https://www.progressive.com/">Progressive</app-link>. Any day I can help make something a bit easier
    for another developer is a great day.

    As a developer, my passion is around making great web apps and easy to consume API. Developing web apps is a chance
    to enjoy the blending of science and art. Being creative while considering usability, accessibility, inclusivity,
    and simplicity is perfection, like a delicious bowl of hot ramen üçú.

    effectively.
